-	Why should we use function at all?
The first reason is reusability. Once a function is defined, it can be used over and over and over again. You can invoke the same function many times in your program, which saves you work.
-	 How to define/declare a function?
def name_fuction(arguments):
	statements
-	How to call/use a function?
name_function(arguments)
-	What is return, why and how do we use it?
Return statement is followed an expression. This expression will be evaluated and returned to the caller as the answer of calling this function.
Because with some functions you need to return values, so you can be used to build more complex expressions.
def name_function(arguments):
	statements
	return values
-	Do we have to use return in every function?
No. Because some functions are not executed for its resulting value
-	What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it?
Inside the function, the values that are passed get assigned to variables called parameters. 	  
Because most functions require arguments: the arguments provide for generalization.
max(1, 2, 3, 14, 5)
>>> 5
-	How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?
from name_file import name_function
result = name_function(arguments)
